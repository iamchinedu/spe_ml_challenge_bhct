# **ðŸ“Œ Project Description**

## **ðŸ”¹ Background**
In drilling operations, **Bottom Hole Circulating Temperature (BHCT)** plays a crucial role in **well stability, mud properties, and overall drilling efficiency**. Accurately predicting BHCT is essential for optimizing **drilling fluid design** and **preventing downhole complications**.

## **ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement**
Traditional methods of estimating BHCT rely on **empirical correlations or simplified models**, which often fail to account for **complex drilling conditions, fluid dynamics, and real-time operational variations**. Additionally, inconsistent data, **outliers, and missing values** further degrade predictive accuracy.

## **ðŸ”¹ Project Objective**
This project aims to **develop a robust predictive model** for BHCT using **machine learning algorithms** to:
âœ… Improve prediction accuracy over conventional models.  
âœ… Handle missing and erroneous data effectively.  
âœ… Capture both feature interactions and sequential dependencies in drilling data.  

## **ðŸ”¹ Significance of the Project**
- **Enhances Well Safety** â†’ Better BHCT prediction reduces the risk of **wellbore instability**.
- **Optimizes Mud Design** â†’ Helps engineers adjust **mud rheology** for efficient heat transfer.
- **Improves Decision-Making** â†’ Enables real-time **BHCT monitoring** using AI-driven insights.
